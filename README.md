# NDHU_CSIE1040

`NDHU_CSIE1040` belongs to National Dong Hwa University. In this course, we aim to train students in how to write programs to solve problems. Programming is a fundamental skill for students majoring in computer science and engineering. Students must devote a significant amount of time to developing this crucial professional skill while taking this course. We will assign numerous programming assignments to enable students to solidify their programming capabilities through hands-on practice. Code copying is strictly forbidden for any assignment. Any violation of this rule will be penalized severely, with no leniency. Ultimately, students should aim to pass the qualification examination in basic programming, which is held periodically by the department.
